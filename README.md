# Healthy or Unhealthy Snack

This is my first Machine Learning app. I'm following the tutorial from 'Machine Learning by Tutorials by Ray Wenderlich'.

It is a simple app, you point the phone at your plate and it tells you if it is healthy or unhealthy.

The ML model which makes the decision has been downloaded from the Apple website. The beauty of ML is that you can replace the ML model with some other kind. Eg. a model which identifies the kind of car.
The rest of the app can stay the same and simply by changing the model you can get an app which identifies other things.
